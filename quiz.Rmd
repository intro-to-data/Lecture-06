# Instructions

The goal of this quiz is to help me understand what you have learned thus far in our time together. As with all other tasks in this course, I am going to treat you like programmers, with a few caveats. To complete the tasks in this exam, you may use the following:

  - Any/all class lecture notes, labs, cheat sheets from RStudio, etc.
  - Any assigned reading/video.
  - Google (If you are really desperate, Bing.)
  - Stack Overflow

However, I must require you to complete your own exam. You may not help anyone else in this class and you may not accept help from anyone else in the class. If you have any questions, please ask me. Any clarifications I make will be announced to the entire class. 

This is a do-at-home quiz. The layout/structure of the quiz is identical to the labs you have completed. There is no separate lab this week, so that should help. Complete the tasks below and answer the associated questions in Canvas. This quiz focuses on single table data transformations and plotting. Relational data will make an appearance on Quiz 02.

# SETUP

Remember, you must load your packages (`tidyverse`, etc.) and data for EACH session in R. Just because you had the `tidyverse` loaded last time means nothing for the current session. A new session is started each time you log into RStudio Cloud.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

## Makes large/small numbers more human-friendly.
options(scipen = 999)


Appointments <- read_csv("./data/Appointments.csv")
Appointments
```

# Appointments

A no-show appointment occurs when a patient makes an appointment with
their doctor, receives all of the instructions, and does not come to
their appointment. Understanding the likelihood of a patient skipping
their appointment is helpful for providers and their staff.

Although this data set is specific to Brazil and is taken from Kaggle,
this is a very real problem we work on here in the Capital District.
With that said, this data is specific to the context from which it was
collected. Do not assume the patterns seen in this data are necessarily
true here. Context matters.

<https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments>

**Grain:** Each row of data is a *single appointment*. A patient may
have more than one appointment. (Many do.)

## Data Dictionary

  - PatientId: Unique identifier for that patient.
  - AppointmentID: Unique identifier for each appointment
  - Gender: Male (M) or Female (F).
  - AppointmentDate: The Date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the appointment
  - AppointmentDay: An abbreviation of the name of the day of the
    appointment (Mon, Tue, etc.)
  - AppointmentMonth: The abbreviation of the name of the month of the
    appointment.
  - Age: Patient age, on the day of the appointment, in years.
  - Neighbourhood: Where the appointment takes place.
  - Scholarship: TRUE or FALSE
      - For more detail:
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia>
  - Hipertension: Does the patient have hypertension? TRUE or FALSE
      - Note the unusual spelling of this column.
  - Diabetes: Does the patient have diabetes? TRUE or FALSE
  - Alcoholism: Does the patient have diabetes? TRUE or FALSE
  - Handcap: Does the patient have a handicap? TRUE or FALSE
      - Note the unusual spelling of this column.
      - Not my typo.
  - ReceivedSMS: Did the patient receive a SMS? TRUE or FALSE
  - NoShow: Did the patient no-show? TRUE or FALSE
      - **Hint:** R treats Boolean TRUE values as equal to 1 and FALSE
        values as equal to 0. You can sum a column of TRUE/FALSE values
        to get the count of TRUE.

## Something useful:

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/integration_by_parts.png)

- Remember, use a SINGLE EQUALS SIGN for assignment when you are in a function.
- Use DOUBLE EQUAL SIGNS for boolean tests (in filter).
- Use `<-` to assign the final results to a new table for reuse later.



# Tasks


## Task 01: How Many No-Shows?

- How many appointments were recorded as a no-show?
- You may notice that NoShow is a TRUE/FALSE column, a Boolean.
    - R handles these values in a special way.
    - TRUE == 1
    - FALSE == 0
    - So, if you `sum()` a column of TRUE/FALSE values the end result is the count of rows equal to TRUE.
    - Today, this is smashingly convenient.
- When you create a new column via summarize, give it a name.
    - Call it a best practice. Doesn't change your answer, but it could change your life.
    - It looks nicer AND it can save you some pain/effort later.
    - In this case,  calling the `sum()` `N` seems appropriate.
    - I mean, it's just a thought. Do what you want.

```{r}

```


## Task 02: No-Shows by Neighbourhood?

- Which neighbourhood had the most no-shows?
    - **Hint:** Spelling matters. ðŸ‘€
- You can use your code from Task 01 to help you.
- Did you rename your sum() or do you have a column that looks like `sum(foo)` in Task 01?
- The next couple of tasks depend on the data frame formed by this task.
    - Create a  new table called . . . . whatever you want and reuse this new data for tasks 03 and 04.
    - Remember, in order to see you results, you have to print the new table into the notebook.
    - If you called your new table `foo` then make sure `foo` is on the last line of your notebook and that will print it into the notebook for you to see.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```


Task 03: Plot No-Shows by Neighbourhood

- Reuse the table you created in task 02.
- Plot No-Shows by neighborhood and upload the graph to Canvas.
- This should be a bar plot.
    - Remember, `geom_col` is your friend here.
        - `r ?geom_col` to read function documentation and look at examples.
    - I suggest you make Neighbourhood your y-axis aesthetic.
    - When you maximize the size of the plot, it be legible.
    - If you don't . . . . . yeah. It wom't be.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```


## Task 04: 822145925426128

  - How many appointments did patient 822145925426128 (`PatientID`) have?
  - How many no-shows did 822145925426128 have?
  - You can do this in a single code chunk or two. I don't care.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```


## Task 05: No-Shows For Patients Over 50

- How many no-shows were recorded by patients over the age of 50?

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```


## Task 06: Average Age NoShow

- What is the average age of a no-show patient (`mean()`)?
- What is the standard deviation of the age of a no-show patient (`sd()`)?
- You can complete this task with a single code chunk, but if you use
    two and get the right answers, you will get full credit.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```


## Task 07: ReceivedSMS

  - One popular intervention for no-shows is to call patients before
    their appointment, to remind them of their upcoming appointment.
  - In `Appointments` we have a column called `ReceivedSMS`. Where
    `TRUE`, these patients received a text message reminding them of
    their upcoming appointment.
  - Who had a higher no-show rate?
      - ReceivedSMS == TRUE
      - ReceivedSMS == FALSE
  - To answer this question, you will need to group by `ReceivedSMS` and
    then calculate the rate of no-shows for each group. This is similar
    to something we did in a recent lab.
  - Remember, you can name the columns in `summarize()`.
      - You will need two columns. And PLEASE NAME THEM to make them usable later.
      - One column for the total number of No Shows.
      - One column for the total number of Appointments.
  - Use `mutate()` to create a new column for the rate of No Shows.

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```

Do these results surprise you? They might. Try to think of one or two reasons why this could be true.


## Task 08: Chronic Conditions

  - Create a new table, called `NoShowRate` which compares the no-show
    rate of two groups.
      - Use this to compare the no-show rate of patients with/without
        hypertension and diabetes.
  - Create a bar plot (`geom_col()`) comparing the rate of no-shows per
    1,000 appointments.
  - Create a separate plot for those with/without hypertension and
    with/without diabetes.
  - Please upload the diabetes plot.
      - Remember, you can export a plot from RStudio.
  - Compared to the rest of the population, how would you describe the
    no-show rate of patients with these chronic conditions?
      - Higher no-show rate
      - Lower no-show rate
      - Similar no-show rate

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
##Hint: Name your results in both summarize and
## mutate so you can use them as variables later.
```


## Task 09: Distribution of No-Shows

  - Create a new table, called `NoShowCounts`.
  - The `Appointments` table is at the appointment grain.
  - This new table, `NoShowCounts`, should be at the patient grain. This
    means each row in `NoShowCounts` should be a single patient and no
    patient should duplicate.
  - Create a histogram showing the distribution of no-show appointments.
      - Upload your histogram of no-shows.
  - How many distinct patients are in your `NoShowCounts` table?
      - If you made your table right, this should be the number of rows
        in your `NoShowCounts` table.
  - How would you describe the distribution of no-shows?
      - Normally distributed
      - Skewed

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```

## Task 10: New Column Over50

  - Create a column which identifies patients who are over 50 years old.
  - Call this new column `Over50`. (Use `mutate()`)
  - This column should contain TRUE/FALSE values for each appointment.
    In other words, this new column goes into the `Appointments` table,
    not a new table.
  - How would you describe the no-show rate of patients over 50 compared
    to other patients?
      - Higher
      - Lower
      - About the same
  - Once you have created your new column, this is very similar to Task
    7.  

```{r}
## YOUR CODE HERE!
```



# Good Luck!

I'll leave you with a little humor.
