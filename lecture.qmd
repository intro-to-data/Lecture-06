## Goals

- Discuss Precision vs Accuracy
- Review and Consolidate:
    - Week 04 Lab
    - Week 05 Lab

## What is this?

## A Priori

- Measurement in modern medicine is both more accurate and more precise than at any other time in human history.
- "Big data" and advanced modeling technologies are also more sensitive to small differences in cohorts.
- Our belief in the precision & accuracy of data can mislead us.
- Race: It is neither precise nor accurate.
  - Not the only problem in our data.
- Today's examples:
  - BMI
  - Blood Pressure



# BMI

AKA Body Mass Index

## BMI Background{.smaller}

| WEIGHT         | STATUS          |
|:---------------|:----------------|
| Below 18.5     | Underweight     |
| 18.5 - 24.9    | Healthy Weight  |
| 25.0 - 29.9    | Overweight      |
| 30.0 and Above | Obesity         |

Calculation:

- Body weight (kilograms)
- Body height (meters)
- $BMI = kg/m^2$

**Source:** [https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/)

## Sources of Error (BMI)

- Height
    - Shoes
- Weight
    - Clothes
    - Shoes
    - Phone
    - Watch
    - Accuracy of scale (tare?)

## Weight of Clothes {.smaller}

![](includes/clothes.jpg){fig-align="center"}

- With the weight of the phone (used to take the photo) it is 3 pounds, 11.5 ounces.
- 1Kg = 2.2 pounds

## Does This Matter? (BMI)

- I am 1.8 meters tall.
- Calculate my BMI at 77, 79, and 81 kg.
    - $BMI = kg/m^2$
    - Healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.
    - Overweight BMI is between 25.0 and 29.9.
- Trends vs Patient-specific decision



# BP

AKA Blood Pressure

## Blood Pressure (BP)

| CLASSIFICATION       | SYSTOLIC      | DIASTOLIC     |
|:---------------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| Normal               | 119 or lower  | 79 or lower   |
| Pre-hypertension     | 120 to 139    | 80 to 89      |
| Stage 1 hypertension | 140 to 159    | 90 to 99      |
| Stage 2 hypertension | 160 or higher | 100 or higher |
Blood Pressure is measured in MM HG.

## Sources of Error (BP){.smaller}

- Patient should be seated comfortably, with back supported, legs uncrossed, and upper arm bared.
    - Diastolic pressure is higher in the seated position, whereas systolic pressure is higher in the supine position.
    - An unsupported back may increase diastolic pressure.
    - Crossing the legs may increase systolic pressure.
- Patient's arm should be supported at heart level.
    - If the upper arm is below the level of the right atrium, the readings will be too high.
    - If the upper arm is above heart level, the readings will be too low.
    - If the arm is unsupported and held up by the patient, pressure will be higher.
- Neither the patient nor the person taking the measurement should talk during the procedure.

## Does This Matter? (BP)

- The impact for any particular error is hard to predict.
    - Because we often get more than one of these wrong.
- A delayed diagnosis of hypertension can cause real harm.
- Treating non-existent hypertension can also cause harm.

## The Moral Of This Slide Deck{.smaller .scollable}

- Different sources of data have different sources of error:
    - Engineering/Lab: Generally more precise and errors tend to be randomly distributed. Examples: Measuring temperature or mass of a sample.
    - Discipline: Scientific disciplines have different expectations of accuracy/precision. Don't use assumptions from chemistry to assess a psychology experiment.
    - Admin data: This is a huge source of data. And much of it is . . . questionable.
        - If the person collecting the data isn't using/accountable for the data, it has problems.
- Accuracy is not the same as precision:
    - I told you I am 1.8 meters tall. (Not 1.6 and not 1.81)
    - We often assume/interpret higher precision as higher accuracy.
- In Public Health: Data is biased, incomplete, and comes with built-in errors.
